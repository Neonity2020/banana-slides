Supports seamless two-way switching between both modes ([Documentation](https://docs.bananaslides.online/zh/features/templates))
- **[2026-04-25]**: Asset Toolbox launched — adds three new modes: full-image editing, marquee editing (overlay/replace), and smart erase, built on existing asset generation with a unified one-stop entry.
- **[2026-04-25]**: Supports account linking via official OpenAI OAuth login. Once linked, Codex can be used directly as a text/image generation provider without manually entering an API Key. Plus accounts can generate 100+ 2K images every five hours ([Tutorial](https://ziy68cvfvu3.feishu.cn/wiki/LDSOwPzkhiNonkkNTF1ct2VBnNc)) (Based on official OpenAI OAuth PKCE authorization flow, not reverse-engineered)
- **[2026-04-25]**: Supports saving custom text style description templates with naming, color-coding, and persistent reuse, eliminating the need for repeated entry.
- **[2026-04-23]**: Added support for the gpt-image-2 model. Editable background export effects have also improved due to upgraded model capabilities (Select "Generative Acquisition" in Settings - Export Options - Background Acquisition).
- **[2026-04-11]**: Supported [CLI operations and added agent skills](https://docs.bananaslides.online/cli)
- **[2026-03]**: Added various features and optimizations, such as extra fields and multi-aspect ratio settings.
- **[2026-02-09]**: New Features and Optimizations
  * New Features
    * Support for pasting images directly into the homepage, outline, or description cards for immediate recognition, providing a better interactive experience.
    * Manual Outline Editing: Supports manually adjusting the chapter (part) a page belongs to.
    * Docker Multi-architecture: Image supports amd64 / arm64 builds.
    * Internationalization + Dark Mode: Added English/Chinese toggle; supports Light/Dark/Follow System themes; all components adapted for dark mode.
  * Fixes and Experience Optimizations
    * Fixed export-related 500 errors, reference file association timing, outline/page data misalignment, task polling for incorrect projects, infinite polling in description generation, image preview memory leaks, and partial failure handling in bulk deletions.
    * Optimized format example prompts, HTTP error message copy, Modal closing experience, cleanup of old project localStorage, and removed redundant prompts when creating the first project.
    * Various other optimizations and fixes.

> **Desktop Version Configuration, Storage, and Export Tips**: The desktop installation package does not include a project root `.env` file; please save API configurations directly in "Settings." "Data Storage Location" can be selected during the initial Windows installation; it can also be modified in "Settings → Data Storage Location" on all desktop platforms, taking effect after a restart. The application will not automatically migrate or delete old data; before manual migration, the application must be fully exited from the system tray, and the `data`, `uploads`, and `exports` directories must be copied in full. The desktop version completes OpenAI OAuth in the system browser and automatically displays as connected after a successful callback without needing to refresh the app. Desktop exports trigger a system save dialog, and the download is only considered complete once the file is successfully written to the selected location; if the write fails, the destination path and error information will be displayed, and it can be redownloaded from the "Export Tasks" panel.

## ✨ Project Origins

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: a presentation is due tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult 
- 3️⃣ Similar visual outcomes with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layouts with poor design sense

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompt while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Quickly gain design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text elements.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, allowing focus on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation to various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯 Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations.</b>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creation Paths

Supports three starting methods: **Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**, catering to different creative habits.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and the AI automatically generates a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions via natural language (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with real-time AI adjustments.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual adjustment of details.
- **More Reliable Markdown Import**: The import dialog previews the number of recognized pages before execution and appends pages all at once based on the file sequence, preventing formatting errors or inconsistent page ordering during multi-page imports.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF, Docx, MD, Txt, and other file formats; the system automatically parses the content in the background.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information within the text, providing rich source material for generation.
- **Automatic Image Storage**: Images extracted from documents are automatically added to the project material library along with the reference files for direct reuse later.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.
- **Combined Multi-image Reference**: When using GPT Image, both the image templates and the material images in the page descriptions are sent to the model together, rather than only using the first reference image.

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer limited by complex menu buttons, issue modification commands directly through **natural language**.
- **Inpainting (Local Modification)**: Make conversational-style modifications to unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Page-wide Optimization**: Generate high-definition pages with a unified style based on nano banana pro🍌.
- **Quality Control Mode**: Can be enabled in system settings or the preview page. It automatically checks for garbled text, low-quality visuals, and prompt deviation after generation; only images that pass the check will be saved as new versions.
- **Page Property Panel**: Pull out a resizable property drawer from the right edge of the preview page. Edit titles, chapters, page descriptions (supports pasting images and additional description fields), page-level templates, and voiceover scripts while viewing the image. It automatically saves once you stop typing, eliminating the need to repeatedly open and close pop-up windows.

### 4. Out-of-the-box format export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transition animations before exporting to PPTX. Supports classic effects such as Fade, Push, Pan, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, and Clock, with the option to multi-select for random application.
- **Exported File Management**: The preview page lists files already exported on the server, allowing you to directly download or delete unneeded files. Export task history is isolated by project to avoid accidental deletion of records from other projects. If a backend task becomes unavailable after refreshing, the task panel will clearly display a failure status and prompt for re-export.
- **Video Export Configuration Pre-check**: Loading status is displayed before opening the narrated video panel. If the output language or ElevenLabs configuration fails to load, a clear retry prompt will appear instead of proceeding with uncertain default values.
- **Clearer Selected Page Export**: The selected page export feature now prompts for missing images based on the current selection range. Unselected draft pages will no longer cause the export entry for completed pages to be grayed out. For narrated videos, pages without images will only be included if the placeholder frame option is explicitly checked.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio ensures the layout requires no secondary adjustments for direct presentation.

### 6. One-click Export of Explanation Videos

- **One-click conversion of slides into presentation videos (MP4) with AI voiceovers and subtitles**
- AI automatically generates natural-sounding narrations based on page descriptions and content
- Supports configuration of multiple expression styles, languages, and voice tones

**Use the new editable export configuration method to achieve better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter), and fill it into the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a sufficient free usage quota). For details, see the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through GCP service accounts, and new users can use the trial credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synchronized with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version's SHA; the current Git SHA is also used for determination when running from source.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configuration in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Access the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You must first revert the code to the version at the time of the pull.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos; must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**. Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout issues during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore certain special effects. Uploading PDF files does not require LibreOffice. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed via this method will be lost after the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
```

# macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend automatically connects to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (defaults to `http://localhost:5011`). To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root directory.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important data locally, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Front-end Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
