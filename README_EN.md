## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: your presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank? You have countless brilliant ideas in your head, yet all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design.

We all long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for speed, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Can only choose from preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute. 
- 3️⃣ Similar visual results, suffering from severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented text-image layouts with poor design aesthetics.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy the two core needs of presentation creation: "speed" and "beauty." Even those that claim to be "Vibe PPT" are still far from being truly "vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I experimented with 🍌pro for slide generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompt while strictly adhering to the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold; no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and graphic-text element combinations to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, allowing focus on content rather than formatting and beautification.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with quick adaptation across multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly produce beautiful and professional presentations.</b>
</p>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creation Paths

Supports three starting modes—**Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**—to satisfy different creative habits.
- **One-sentence generation**: Input a topic, and the AI automatically generates a clearly structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports natural language modifications to the outline or description via Vibe (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with AI adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual adjustment of details.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF, Docx, MD, Txt, and other file formats; the system automatically parses the content in the background.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information within the text, providing rich source material for generation.
- **Automatic Image Storage**: Images extracted from document parsing are automatically added to the project material library once reference files are linked to a project, allowing for easy reuse later.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Document Parsing and Material Processing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cda1fd2-2369-4028-b310-ea6604183936" />

### 3. "Vibe-style" Natural Language Modification

No longer restricted by complex menus and buttons; issue modification commands directly through **natural language**.
- **Partial Redrawing**: Perform verbal modifications on specific areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-page Optimization**: Generate high-definition, stylistically consistent pages based on nano banana pro🍌.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ba24a-996c-4f6d-9ec6-818be6b08ea3" />

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transition animations before exporting to PPTX. Supports classic effects like Fade, Push, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, Clock, etc., with the option to multi-select for random application.
- **Export File Management**: The preview page lists exported files on the server; you can download them directly or delete files no longer needed. Export task history is cleared by project to avoid accidental deletion of records from other projects.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio ensures the layout requires no manual adjustments and is ready for immediate presentation.

**Use the new editable export configuration method to achieve better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter) and fill it into the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is ample free usage quota). See instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through a GCP service account, and new users can use promotional credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Image (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can navigate to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The application will determine if there are available updates based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA is also used for the check.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You must first revert the code to the version at the time of the pull.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos; must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when using the "PPT Refurbish" feature to upload PPTX files, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore certain effects. LibreOffice is not required if you upload PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after container reconstruction and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, follow the previously described method to open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key.

Since no Chinese Markdown content was provided in the "Original content" section of your request, there is no text to translate. Please provide the content you would like translated within the code block.

#### Front-end Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root directory.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`  
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and outputs are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
